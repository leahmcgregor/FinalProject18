Dating Simulator V 1.0 is exactly what it sounds like: a dating simulator. You play a character (whose name you are allowed to choose) as they go through their junior year of high school. The goal of the game is to win over your character's love interest and to achieve high honor roll by the end of the first marking period. You can do so by obtaining likeability points and good grades through a choice-based story system.
